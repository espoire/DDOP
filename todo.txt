TODO
    Finish implementing LoadoutRefinement
    Move all set bonuses over to JSONs
    Implement augments
        (EquipmentLoadout, StatScorer) -> Set<Augment>
        Per augment series:
            Filter augments below the highest augment below the lowest level item
            Filter augments above the highest level item
            Filter augments with undeclared stats
        Score all remaining augments
        Fill most restricted slots first
            Use highest score that still fits in that slot
                Strike from list
    Implement weapon stats, particularly Duality vs Fetters

Implement automatic minor artifact flagging
    Pull Minor Artifacts list from URL = https://ddowiki.com/page/Minor_Artifact#List_of_artifacts
    Write above list to minorArtifacts.json
    Update MinorArtifact.java to use the json file.

Pull in U47 items
    Automate fetching latest named items page?
        Clean up gear definition updates:
            Force update items whose UPDATED_ITEMS files were force updated
            error text sources:
                Minimum Level = null
                File already exists
                Unrecognised item slot:
                    cosmetic headwear
                    cosmetic cloak
    Automate fetch all named items
        Overwrite item WGet script file
        Provide console command to invoke script
            ? Run command automatically?
        Detect recent rerun; parse HTML without code modification
        ? Parse directly to JSON, without .wikiitem layover?

Improve optimizer:
    Profile execution

    Alternate algorithm:
        Implement "look ahead"
        Divide remaining run time / trials proportionally to the candidate items for the first item slot, based on their relative scores.
        For each of those item, time/trial budget pairs:
            Add that item to the working build.
            If this WAS the last slot: score, return build:score pair.
            If this wasn't the last slot:
                If the remaining budget is X (small constant) trials or less: break to random search, return best build:score pair found.
                Divide remaining budget proportionally to the candidate items for the next item slot, based on their relative scores.
                For each of those item, time/trial budget pairs:
                    Recurse.
                    Receive from each a completed build:score pair.
                Iterate over the resulting collection of build:score pairs.
                Return the best build:score pair.
        We should now have an exceedingly good build.
