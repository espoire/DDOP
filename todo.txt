Implement minor artifact flagging
    Pull Minor Artifacts list from URL = https://ddowiki.com/page/Minor_Artifact#List_of_artifacts
    Associate links from above list to item links being read during update
        Save item URL in item data
        Add Minor Artifact tag to items with URL on that list

Pull in U47 items
    Automate fetching latest named items page?
        Clean up gear definition updates:
            Force update items whose UPDATED_ITEMS files were force updated
            error text sources:
                Minimum Level = null
                File already exists
                Unrecognised item slot:
                    cosmetic headwear
                    cosmetic cloak
    Automate fetch all named items
        Overwrite item WGet script file
        Provide console command to invoke script
            ? Run command automatically?
        Detect recent rerun; parse HTML without code modification
        ? Parse directly to JSON, without .wikiitem layover?

Implement minor artifact exclusion
    CANNOT equip two items with this flag

Improve optimizer:
    Profile execution

    Limit attribute copying overhead

    Improved random algorithm:
        encode loadouts as a series of indices
        cache previously-tested serials

        if trials > permutations, swap to exhaustive search

        add logic to try 1-3 slot adjustments from the known maximum

    Alternate algorithm:
        Implement "look ahead"
        Divide remaining run time / trials proportionally to the candidate items for the first item slot, based on their relative scores.
        For each of those item, time/trial budget pairs:
            Add that item to the working build.
            If this WAS the last slot: score, return build:score pair.
            If this wasn't the last slot:
                If the remaining budget is X (small constant) trials or less: break to random search, return best build:score pair found.
                Divide remaining budget proportionally to the candidate items for the next item slot, based on their relative scores.
                For each of those item, time/trial budget pairs:
                    Recurse.
                    Receive from each a completed build:score pair.
                Iterate over the resulting collection of build:score pairs.
                Return the best build:score pair.
        We should now have an exceedingly good build.



Implement Augments

Implement item categories / generators
    Cannith Crafted
    Legendary Green Steel
    Slavers
    Randomgen

Mechanics Updates:
    Dodge absolute 95% cap
    Incorp/Concealment reduced in reaper?
        Placeholder one-quarter-total reduction in r1+, needs correction.
    Docent PRR
        Mithral Body + Light Armor Prof.   - 1.0 * BAB
        Adamantine Body + Heavy Armor Prof - 2.0 * BAB


Cleanup unruly mods:
	enhanced ki
		Shows as:
			"ki" x (enhancement)
		Should be:
			"enhanced ki" x
	main hand:
	off hand:
	either hand:
	better offhanded: while this item is in your offhand, it gains +2[w].
		Some item functions differently based on which hand it is in.
		Split into two items at compile time?
	enhancement bonus
		Convert into (weapon) (armor) or (shield) variants
	x augment slot
		Needs to stack

Stat conversions:
	shining silver scales
	    "cold absorption" X (default)
	lesser fire resistance
	    fire resistance 5 (enhancement)
	fire resistance (default magnitude: 10)
	improved fire resistance
	    fire resistance 20 (enhancement)
	greater fire resistance
	    fire resistance 30 (enhancement)
	superior fire resistance
	    fire resistance 40 (enhancement)
	enhanced ghostly
	    incorporeality 15 (default)
	protection from evil (default magnitude: 2)
	    saves vs evil X (resistance)
	    ac X (deflection)
	    command immunity

NYI stats:
    command immunity
    speed (if roman numerals, X alacrity + 2X movement BUT if arabic numerals, 0.5X alacrity + X movement)
    raging strength
	extra smites
	cold vulnerability
		vulnerability (boolean)
